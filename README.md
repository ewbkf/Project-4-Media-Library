I was unable to get this program to work in replit. I don't know what evil magic is at work but it just wont work. I have tried creating new replits, copying the entire vs folder into replit, copying individaul blocks of code manually. Please clone this repo and run the program on your machine locally. If you have issues please let us know and we will work to get you a working version. I have never experienced this issue before. 

If you prefer I can just email you a copy of the file, or even bring you a flashdrive tomorrow with the files. 

Thank you for your understanding! Have a great weekend.
